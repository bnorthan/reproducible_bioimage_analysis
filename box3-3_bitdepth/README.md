**Create Figure 3: Bit Depth Conversion and Normalization**

ImageJ macro to run: *CropEnhanceCompare_v2.ijm*

Image worked on: *Week1_150607_C02_s3_w1E54F0108-F44A-4F6E-9637-6A9DE80F0823.tif* from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC021, zip file: BBBC021_v1_images_Week1_22123.zip

Produces series of png and 8-bit tif images

Assumes that all files are stored and saved to the desktop of user "simon" on mac OS

Also contains the system file *scientifig_v1.svg* for the Fiji plugin *ScientiFig*, 
used to create the figure in the paper, based on some of the pngs created by the Fiji macro.

The macro *CropConvertEnhance.ijm* is not used for figure creation but for exploring the scaling and conversion behavior of ImageJ/Fiji, not all of which is explained in the ImageJ/Fiji documentation.
